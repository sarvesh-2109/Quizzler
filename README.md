# Quizzler - Quiz Application Using Open Trivia Database

## Overview

Quizzler is a Python quiz application built using the Open Trivia Database API. The application presents a series of true/false questions to the user and tracks their score. The questions are fetched from the Open Trivia Database, covering a variety of topics.

## Project Structure

The project consists of several files:

- **main.py**: Initializes the quiz by creating a question bank from the Open Trivia Database and sets up the QuizBrain and QuizInterface.
- **data.py**: Fetches question data from the Open Trivia Database using the requests library and stores it for later use.
- **question_model.py**: Defines the Question class to represent quiz questions.
- **quiz_brain.py**: Implements the QuizBrain class to manage the quiz logic, track the score, and check answers.
- **ui.py**: Creates the graphical user interface using Tkinter, including labels, buttons, and a canvas for question presentation.
